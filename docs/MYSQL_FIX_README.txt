ISSUE RESOLVED:
===============
The installer was hardcoded to look for MySQL Server 9.1 only.
This caused connection failures when MySQL 8.0 was installed.

FIXED FILES:
============
1. INSTALL_ONE_CLICK.bat (main installer)
2. deployment\INSTALL_MYSQL.bat
3. deployment\setup_mysql_database.bat

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
=================
Replaced hardcoded MySQL 9.1 paths with intelligent detection that
automatically finds and uses ANY of these MySQL versions:

  ✓ MySQL 8.0  (Most common)
  ✓ MySQL 8.1
  ✓ MySQL 8.2
  ✓ MySQL 9.0
  ✓ MySQL 9.1

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
=================
The installer will:
1. Search for MySQL installations starting from newest to oldest
2. Use the first MySQL version found
3. Display which version was detected
4. Proceed with that version for all database operations

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================
1. Right-click on INSTALL_ONE_CLICK.bat
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. Follow the prompts
4. When asked for MySQL password, enter: Icanttellyou1
5. The installer will detect your MySQL 8.0 installation automatically

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================
Before: "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 9.1\bin\mysql.exe"
After:  %MYSQL_PATH% (dynamically set based on what's installed)

The detection logic checks in order:
- MySQL Server 9.1 → 9.0 → 8.2 → 8.1 → 8.0

If no MySQL is found, the installer provides clear instructions on
how to install MySQL before proceeding.

COMPATIBILITY:
==============
✓ Windows 10/11
✓ MySQL 8.0 or higher
✓ Node.js 20.x (auto-installed if needed)

SUPPORT:
========
If you encounter issues:
1. Verify MySQL service is running
2. Confirm password is correct
3. Check MySQL is in default installation location:
   C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server [VERSION]\

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         Installation should now work perfectly!
