# MySQL Version Documentation Update Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Issue:** Installation instructions did not specify exact MySQL version, causing users to accidentally install incompatible versions (8.4.x or 9.x)  
**Resolution:** Added comprehensive MySQL version documentation throughout the installation package

---

## Problem Statement

The MySQL download page now shows **MySQL 9.x and 8.4.x** as the primary download options. These are "Innovation Release" versions with breaking changes that are **NOT compatible** with PalmExitGarage.

Users installing the application would:
1. Visit the MySQL download page
2. See MySQL 9.x or 8.4.x as the featured version
3. Download and install the wrong version
4. Experience compatibility issues, errors, and application failures

The original documentation only mentioned "MySQL 8.0 or higher" without clarifying that newer versions are incompatible.
