# GitHub Upload Instructions for PalmExitGarage

Your local Git repository has been initialized and all files have been committed. Follow these steps to upload your project to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Open https://github.com in your browser
2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account
3. **Create new repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - **Repository name**: `PalmExitGarage` (exactly as specified)
   - **Description**: `Professional Auto Repair Management System - Full-stack web application for managing auto repair shop operations`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private (your preference)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

### Option A: If you see the "Quick setup" page
Copy the HTTPS URL that looks like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PalmExitGarage.git`

### Option B: Use the commands GitHub provides
GitHub will show you something like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PalmExitGarage.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Execute the Commands

Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in your `C:\PalmExitGarage` directory and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\PalmExitGarage"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PalmExitGarage.git

# Rename master branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Authentication

When you run `git push`, you may be prompted for authentication:

### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with 'repo' permissions
3. Use your GitHub username and the token as password when prompted

### Option B: GitHub Desktop
If you prefer a GUI, you can:
1. Download and install GitHub Desktop
2. Clone your newly created repository
3. Copy your local files to the cloned repository
4. Commit and push through the GUI

## Step 5: Verify Upload

After pushing, go to your GitHub repository URL:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PalmExitGarage`

You should see all your files, including:
- âœ… README.md with full documentation
- âœ… Frontend React application
- âœ… Backend Node.js server
- âœ… Database scripts and configurations

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
